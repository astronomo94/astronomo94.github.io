### WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

## ABOUT ME
I'm an astronomer, currently a post-doc ("assegnista di ricerca") at the Brera Astronomical Observatory in Merate (LC), Italy.

### Short Biography
I was born in Gavardo (BS), Italy in 1994. I studied at "Liceo Scientifico G. Perlasca" of Idro (BS), Italy, with a final score of 90/100.
In 2013 I started the 3-years Bachelor Degree in Astronomy (Laurea Triennale in Astronomia) at Padova University, Italy, where I graduated in 2016 with a Thesis on Supermassive Black Holes at the center of distant quasars, under the supervision of Dr. Stefano Ciroi.
Then, I started the 2-years Master Degree in Astronomy (Laurea Magistrale in Astronomia) also at Padova University, and I graduated in 2018 with a Thesis on the interacting Supernova (see below) SN 2013gc, under the supervision of Dr. Andrea Pastorello.
In 2019 I started the 4-years PhD in Astrophysics (Dottorato in Astrofisica) under the supervision of Prof. Giuliano Pignata at Universidad Andres Bello in Santiago, Chile, where I lived for about one year, even though I spent most of the PhD in Padova (also because of the restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic), hosted by the local INAF (Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica) Astronomical Observatory. I was under the co-supervision of Dr. A. Pastorello, and collaborated with the members of the Research group on Supernovae of INAF-OAPd. I got the PhD title in June 2023. 
In July 2023 I was hired as a Researcher at the INAF-Brera Astronomical Observatory, Italy, working on the search and follow-up of electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational waves events, in particular kilonovae, within the GRAWITA Collaboration, under the supervision of Dr. Paolo d'Avanzo.

I'm resident in Sabbio Chiese (BS), even though since 2013 I live in Padova, Italy.

# RESEARCH
SNe, gap transient, interagenti, transienti in generale (occasionally studied Novae and even observed a frew comets)
Now memeber of grawita and engrave, search and follow-iup of electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational waves events, primarly kilonovae (mergers of 2 neutron stars)
Work with researchers from different countries: Spain (NER), Ireland (Morgan), Denmark (Stritzinger), metti avabdiere coe incoen, Chile (Pignata), India (Kuntal), China (Y. Cia9= to name a few.
member of Pessto and NUts collaborations

I'm an expert user of the telescopes and instrumentation of the Asiago Astrophyusical Obsrvatoru, consisteing of the Pennar and EWkar observing station.
Pennar hosts the Galileo 1.22-m tleescope, when inaugurated in 1942 it was the laergest operating telescope in Eureope.
Ekar hosts the Schmidt 67/92 cm telescopes, and the Copernico 1.82-m, built in 1973, the largest on Italian soil.

Work with data from some of largest telescopes in the major astronomical observatorues in the world: LT, NOT, TNG, VLT, NTT, RME available to our collaboration, and even sfrom space: Galex, Spizer, Wise, JWST, HST
Electromagnetic domains from FUV to MIR, passing through NUV, Optical and NIR.

# MISCELLANEOUS (in Italian)

![](./images/me.jpg)

- Suono il trombone da circa 15 anni in una banda sinfonica.
- Sono membro stabile della Filarmonica Conca d'Oro Valle Sabbia e della Banda di Selvazzano Dentro.

Mi piace musica classica e per banda, ma non disdegno altri generi (ABBA, de Andre, TSFH, vangelis, il volo)
Mi piace cucina italiana.

# CONTACT
I'm active on social media, primarily in Italian (Facebook and Instagram), but also in English (Twitter).
