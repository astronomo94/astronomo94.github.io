### WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

## ABOUT ME
I'm an astronomer, currently a post-doc ("assegnista di ricerca") at the Brera Astronomical Observatory in Merate (LC), Italy.

### Short Biography
I was born in Gavardo (BS), Italy in 1994. I studied at "Liceo Scientifico G. Perlasca" of Idro (BS), Italy, with a final score of 90/100.
In 2013 I started the 3-years Bachelor Degree in Astronomy (Laurea Triennale in Astronomia) at Padova University, Italy, where I graduated in 2016 with a Thesis on Supermassive Black Holes at the center of distant quasars, under the supervision of Dr. Stefano Ciroi.
Then, I started the 2-years Master Degree in Astronomy (Laurea Magistrale in Astronomia) also at Padova University, and I graduated in 2018 with a Thesis on the interacting Supernova (see below) SN 2013gc, under the supervision of Dr. Andrea Pastorello.
In 2019 I started the 4-years PhD in Astrophysics (Dottorato in Astrofisica) under the supervision of Prof. Giuliano Pignata at Universidad Andres Bello in Santiago, Chile, where I lived for about one year, even though I spent most of the PhD in Padova (also because of the restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic), hosted by the local INAF (Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica) Astronomical Observatory. 
I was under the co-supervision of Dr. A. Pastorello, and collaborated with the members of the Research group on Supernovae of [INAF-OAPd](https://www.oapd.inaf.it/). I got the PhD title in June 2023. 
In July 2023 I was hired as a Researcher at the INAF-Brera Astronomical Observatory, Italy, working on the search and follow-up of electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational waves events, in particular kilonovae, within the GRAWITA Collaboration, under the supervision of Dr. Paolo d'Avanzo.

I'm resident in Sabbio Chiese (BS), even though since 2013 I live in Padova, Italy.

# RESEARCH
*SNe, gap transient, interagenti, transienti in generale (occasionally studied a few Novae and even observed some comets)
Now memeber of grawita and engrave, search and follow-iup of electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational waves events, primarly kilonovae (mergers of 2 neutron stars)
Work with researchers from different countries: Spain (NER), Ireland (Morgan), Denmark (Stritzinger), metti avabdiere coe incoen, Chile (Pignata), India (Kuntal), China (Y. Cia9= to name a few.
member of Pessto and NUts collaborations, GRAWITA; ENGRAVE; LSST/TVS*

I'm an expert user of the telescopes and instrumentation of the Asiago Astrophysical Observatory, which consists of the Pennar and Mount Ekar observing stations.
The Pennar station hosts the 'Galilei' 1.22-m telescope; when inaugurated in 1942 it was the largest operating telescope in Europe.
The Mount Ekar 'L. Rosino' station hosts the Schmidt 67/92-cm and the Copernico 1.82-m telescopes. The latter, inaugurated in 1973, is currently the largest telescope on the Italian soil.

I work with data (astronomical images and spectra) from some of the largest optical/near-infrared telescopes hosted in the major astronomical observatories in the world. Those include: LT, NOT, TNG, GTC (all located on La Palma island), REM, NTT, VLT (located at La Silla and Paranal observatories in Chile). Some of them are available to us through our international collaborations.
*and even sfrom space: Galex, Spizer, Wise, JWST, HST
Electromagnetic domains from FUV to MIR, passing through NUV, Optical and NIR.

# PUBLICATIONS
Until now, I have written 3 peer-reviewed scientific articles as first author, and I am a co-author of more than 30 papers.
In addition, I published more than 100 non-refereed publications (Astronomer Telegrams, AstroNotes, Transient Classification Reports etc.), also as the leading author.
I got circa 500 citations, with an H-index of 13.

# OUTREACH (in Italian)

Da Novembre 2021 in modalità remota, e dall'estate 2022 in presenza, ho fatto da tutor alla scuola estiva [ASYAGO](https://schools.dfa.unipd.it/ASYAGO/) per liceali presso l'Osservatorio Astrofisico di Asiago.

_tenuto conferenze ed incontri pubblici, anche serali.
